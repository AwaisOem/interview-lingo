This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

let question_answers = [
    {
        "question": "What is your experience with Next.js?",
        "answer": "I've worked extensively with Next.js, building various web applications. I appreciate its simplicity in setting up projects, handling server-side rendering, and managing routing. Its built-in features like API routes and static site generation have significantly streamlined my development process.",
        "order": 0
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain the concept of server-side rendering and how it is implemented in Next.js?",
        "answer": "Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique where HTML is generated on the server for each request, rather than in the browser. In Next.js, SSR is implemented using getServerSideProps which allows data to be fetched on the server and passed to the component before rendering. This improves performance and SEO since the content is fully rendered before it reaches the client.",
        "order": 1
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you handle routing in Next.js?",
        "answer": "Routing in Next.js is file-based. Each file in the pages directory automatically becomes a route in the application. Dynamic routing is handled by using square brackets in the file name, such as [id].js for dynamic parameters. This approach simplifies the routing process and reduces the need for additional configuration.",
        "order": 2
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you discuss your experience with React and how it relates to Next.js?",
        "answer": "Next.js is built on top of React, so my experience with React directly translates to working with Next.js. Next.js extends React by adding features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and file-based routing, which enhances React's capabilities and improves development efficiency for complex applications.",
        "order": 3
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you optimize performance in Next.js applications?",
        "answer": "Optimizing performance in Next.js involves several strategies: using static site generation (SSG) for pages that donâ€™t require frequent updates, employing server-side rendering (SSR) judiciously, leveraging code splitting and lazy loading, optimizing images with the built-in Image component, and caching data effectively. These techniques help reduce load times and improve user experience.",
        "order": 4
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain the benefits of using Next.js for SEO?",
        "answer": "Next.js improves SEO through server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which provide fully rendered HTML to search engine crawlers. This ensures that all content is indexed correctly. Additionally, Next.js offers features like customizable meta tags, dynamic sitemaps, and optimized loading speeds, all of which contribute to better SEO performance.",
        "order": 5
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you handle data fetching in Next.js?",
        "answer": "Next.js provides several methods for data fetching, including getStaticProps for static generation, getServerSideProps for server-side rendering, and API routes for serverless functions. These methods allow fetching data at build time, request time, or on demand, offering flexibility to match the needs of different use cases.",
        "order": 6
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you discuss your experience with deploying Next.js applications?",
        "answer": "I've deployed Next.js applications using various platforms such as Vercel, which is the default choice and offers seamless integration. I've also used other platforms like Netlify and AWS. The deployment process typically involves building the application, optimizing it, and then deploying it to a hosting provider. Vercel's integration simplifies this with automatic deployments and previews for each commit.",
        "order": 7
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you handle authentication in Next.js applications?",
        "answer": "Authentication in Next.js can be handled using libraries like NextAuth.js, which provides an easy-to-use solution for integrating various authentication providers. For custom solutions, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and sessions can be managed through API routes or middleware, ensuring secure authentication flows.",
        "order": 8
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain the concept of code splitting in Next.js and how it improves performance?",
        "answer": "Code splitting in Next.js involves breaking down the application code into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand. This is done automatically for pages and components, reducing the initial load time by only loading the necessary code for the current page. It improves performance by decreasing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and executed on the client side, leading to faster page loads.",
